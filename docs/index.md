# Welcome to my site!
Here, I publish general information about random topics I want to teach or explain. Everything is explained at an approximately high school level.

The "Academic" tab contains topics regarding facts, taught in my style. The "Philosophy" tab contains topics regarding my opinions, outlook on life, etc.

## Style
This site uses a Wikipedia-style layout (if desired, [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) can be used to view these notes more interactively.) This is because I believe the standard "linear" information portrayals are less representative of how humans actually think, so they are therefore are less than optimal as a teaching medium. 

While a paper or lecture notes are the standard way of presenting information, it can only present it in a single order, chapter by chapter, topic by topic, theorem by theorem. Real information has dependencies and corollaries, which are not necessarily required to be in a certain order. This allows students to learn about the topics they don't understand fully and skip the notes on the topics they already understand.
