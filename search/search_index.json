Changing any symbol could vastly change the meaning of any expression. In any other language, changing a single symbol or character usually doesn't completely alter the meaning of the sentence.</p> <p>For example, if someone were to typo the following sentence:</p> \\[ \\text{\"Hello, my name is Charles!\"} \\rightarrow \\text{\"Helo, my name is Charles!\"} \\] <p>The reader could easily infer that the sentence was misspelled, and in fact, probably reconstruct the original sentence. However, this is not the case for mathematics. the expression</p> \\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{100}n\\rightarrow\\sum_{n=11}^{100}n \\] <p>are only off by 1 single character, yet they mean very different things. A reader, even a mathematician, even knowing that something was wrong with the expression, would not be able to reconstruct the original .</p> <p>Assuming a human brain can only process a certain amount of information, they would necessarily have to read mathematical expressions more slowly than text written in any spoken language. For exmample, perhaps there is a person who is able to read 5 words per second. Even if they were a seasoned mathematician, the amount of time it would take them to read (and understand) the following expression</p> \\[ f(x)=\\int_3^5xe^{-x^2}\\cos(2\\pi y)dy \\] <p>is probably more than a few seconds. Every single detail is important. From the 3 and 5 on the \\(\\int\\) to the \\(dy\\) at the end, implying that the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) need to be treated differently.

However, the ability to be rigorous, while correlated with understanding, is not .</p> <p>For example, when students learn about quadratic equations, they learn about the quadratic formula:</p> \\[ x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\] <p>They are taught \"when you see a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) and need to find the roots, use this equation.\" However, while a student who knows this formula is more likely to understand the basics of quadratic functions, polynomials, parabolas, and roots, simply knowing the formula does not imply that the students understand these topics.</p> <p>So if this example student is asked \"What are the roots of \\(x^2-3x+2\\)?\" and they answer \"1 and 2, because of the quadratic formula\" and show their work appropriately, they get that question correct on the test and move on, only remembering that there's that formula, while quickly forgetting what quadratics are, and probably, what the formula is.</p>"},{"location":"Philosophy/Mathematical-Rigor/#related","title":"Related","text":"<p>Mathematical-Rigor</p>"}]}
